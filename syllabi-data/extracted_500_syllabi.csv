2645699864492.0,"This course examines various theoretical and practical issues related to the pervasive talk about ethics in contemporary society. As a philosophy class taught under the direction of the Bible department, Ethics draws from both important classical arguments related to moral theory and rich biblical-theological insights provided by the Judeo-Christian heritage. A wide variety of issues are discussed, from matters of truth-telling in business to uses of technological wizardry in medical settings, from questions of personal sexuality to concerns about the need for values in public life. Necessarily, most areas receive only very minimal coverage. Generally speaking, the aim throughout the course is not on answering every question but rather on knowing the questions and questioning the answers. Thus, we seek to develop a more careful--and Christian--approach to the complexities of ""ethics"" in contemporary life. In short, we aim to encourage serious thinking. Specifically, the course is designed to provide students with the following: an overview of major theories of philosophical ethical theory an overview of principle Judeo-Christian ethical teachings adequate demonstration of the powerful dynamic of ethics and faith an arena for serious academic inquiry general guidelines for ways to make ethical decisions an atmosphere that encourages both more committed attention to one’s own faith and more respectful tolerance toward the diverse views of others Throughout the course of the semester, students will be encouraged to think critically, read carefully, and write clearly. They will be asked to integrate scholarly resources from the university library and from the internet with contemporary issues met through the news media and through local community service projects.","['an overview of major theories of philosophical ethical theory', 'an overview of principle Judeo-Christian ethical teachings', 'adequate demonstration of the powerful dynamic of ethics and faith', 'an arena for serious academic inquiry', 'general guidelines for ways to make ethical decisions', 'an atmosphere that encourages both more committed attention to one’s own faith and more respectful tolerance toward the diverse views of others']",Communication,4.0,"['interpersonal skills', 'verbal communication', 'medical terminology']","['patient interaction', 'team collaboration', 'patient education.']",ESCO.1170,0.8632117258438406

1675037257860.0,"This course introduces students to environmental and land-use suitability analysis, one of the main land-use/ecological planning techniques. The suitability analysis is an important technique that brings together land use, environmental factors, and social and economic factors to reduce the adverse effects of urban growth and help plan for sustainable development. In general, Suitability Analysis (SA) identifies the most suitable places for locating future growth for each land use by considering all significant factors affecting the outcome. With the advent of GIS, this technique has evolved and been integrated into existing GIS platforms, which allow analysis to combine an unlimited number of factors to analyze the development potential of each land parcel and present visualization of the results. We will discuss different methods related to this analysis and their theoretical underpinning. We will also review examples of their applications to help students understand these techniques' theoretical issues and practical problems. In conjunction with the course discussions, as the primary assignment of the class, students will undertake to apply the land suitability analysis to a peninsula area in the DFW to provide a hands-on experience. This assignment will also help students familiarize themselves with data gathering, encoding, data manipulation, and some of the problems associated with the graphical display of data and results. More importantly, it will help learn data visualization and applied suitability analysis with Geographic Information Systems (GIS), which is becoming standard for the industry, particularly for spatial analysis and land use planning.","['Identify and explain different environmental and land-use suitability analysis techniques To employ environmental and land-use suitability analysis techniques using GIS', 'Describe the significant differences between ecological and land-use suitability analysis techniques', 'Identify and assess the importance of significant environmental and man-made (natural and built environmental) factors that have effects on land development and shape the urban spatial development of cities in the U.S. and elsewhere', 'Identify and explain the important natural environmental and built environmental factors and their characteristics in relation to urban development', 'Understand the differences between rating and weighing systems', 'Perform the use of different relevant factors for environmental and land-use suitability analysis', 'Describe optimization concepts in relation to suitability analysis and differentiate between local and global optimization', 'Identify and explain the land-use/transportation relationship and effects of this relationship on environmental and land-use suitability analysis', 'Describe the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and group techniques, including Delphi.', 'Use the methods in an appropriate setting for the derivation of the weightings', 'Identify and explain the importance of environmental and land-use suitability analysis for development planning']",Visualization,3.0,"['visual communication', '3D perspectives', 'data representation']","['concept presentation', 'design communication', 'spatial understanding']",ESCO.9291,0.8811347692501543

This course will examine many of the major issues in the field of Genomics and show how the incorporation of genomic approaches has helped to explore and merge diverse topics in biology. Over the course of the semester, you will gain expertise in Genomics through the discussion and analysis of current topics, readings of relevant papers from the scientific literature, exercises that apply computational tools for genome analysis, and group projects and presentations that foster creative application of genomic methods. You will learn about the structure, function and diversity of genomes across all lifeforms, the history and future of genome biology, and how genomic tools are used to address questions pertaining to human history, health and disease.

In contemporary societies, management efforts have focused on returning a disturbed ecosystem to some perceived historical condition defined by the stakeholders. Modern ecosystems’ management attempts to recover these complex systems’ composition, structure, and function. Restoration Ecology is interdisciplinary and must consider social, political, economic, and scientific issues to be successful. The class integrates principles from ecology used to repair ecosystems that have been degraded, damaged, or destroyed. In this course, we will focus on what ecological science contributes to restoration ecology; more specifically, students will develop an understanding of ecological theory as it is applied to the restoration of ecosystems and natural resources. The goal is to acquire the knowledge needed to restore the structure of biological communities and ecological functions and improve ecosystem services. This course will cover topics for students who see themselves practicing or participating in natural resource management projects during their careers. Using a combination of lectures, readings, field trips, and project work, we will cover the conceptual and theoretical foundations that underlie restoration efforts and link these to the real‐world applications in the past and ongoing restoration projects.
